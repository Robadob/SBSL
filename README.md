# S&amp;Box Scripting language
Working through the early chapters of *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, 2nd Ed.*, to create a basic partial compiler/interpreted language with syntax similar to GLSL.

This is currently an experimental process, and may never reach a viable status.

I haven't used C# in a while, so will probably break some normal patterns.

Will add CI once it's in a state to add tests.
